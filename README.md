# PHP Sort

This code was a way for me to familiarize myself with more modern versions of PHP by implementing common sorting algorithms using [what I created with Typescript](https://github.com/richardwalenga/typescriptsort) and [with Python](https://github.com/richardwalenga/pythonsort) as a guide. Run [test.php](test.php) which times the implementations against the same large array of random ints. This is written against PHP 8.
